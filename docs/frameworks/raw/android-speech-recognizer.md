public class SpeechRecognizer
extends Object

java.lang.Object
   ↳	android.speech.SpeechRecognizer



This class provides access to the speech recognition service. This service allows access to the speech recognizer. Do not instantiate this class directly, instead, call SpeechRecognizer.createSpeechRecognizer(Context), or SpeechRecognizer.createOnDeviceSpeechRecognizer(Context). This class's methods must be invoked only from the main application thread.

Important: the caller MUST invoke destroy() on a SpeechRecognizer object when it is no longer needed.

The implementation of this API is likely to stream audio to remote servers to perform speech recognition. As such this API is not intended to be used for continuous recognition, which would consume a significant amount of battery and bandwidth.

Please note that the application must have Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO permission to use this class.

Added in API level 33
public void checkRecognitionSupport (Intent recognizerIntent, 
                Executor executor, 
                RecognitionSupportCallback supportListener)

Checks whether recognizerIntent is supported by SpeechRecognizer.startListening(Intent).

Parameters
recognizerIntent	Intent: contains parameters for the recognition to be performed. The intent may also contain optional extras. See RecognizerIntent for the list of supported extras, any unlisted extra might be ignored.
This value cannot be null.


executor	Executor: This value cannot be null.
Callback and listener events are dispatched through this Executor, providing an easy way to control which thread is used. To dispatch events through the main thread of your application, you can use Context.getMainExecutor(). Otherwise, provide an Executor that dispatches to an appropriate thread.


supportListener	RecognitionSupportCallback: the listener on which to receive the support query results.
This value cannot be null.

createOnDeviceSpeechRecognizer
Added in API level 31
public static SpeechRecognizer createOnDeviceSpeechRecognizer (Context context)

Factory method to create a new SpeechRecognizer.

Please note that setRecognitionListener(RecognitionListener) should be called before dispatching any command to the created SpeechRecognizer, otherwise no notifications will be received.

Important: the caller MUST invoke destroy() on a SpeechRecognizer object when it is no longer needed.
This method must be called from the main thread of your app.

Parameters
context	Context: in which to create SpeechRecognizer
This value cannot be null.

Returns
SpeechRecognizer	a new on-device SpeechRecognizer.
This value cannot be null.

Throws
UnsupportedOperationException	iff isOnDeviceRecognitionAvailable(Context) is false
createSpeechRecognizer
Added in API level 8
public static SpeechRecognizer createSpeechRecognizer (Context context)

Factory method to create a new SpeechRecognizer. Please note that setRecognitionListener(RecognitionListener) should be called before dispatching any command to the created SpeechRecognizer, otherwise no notifications will be received.

Important: the caller MUST invoke destroy() on a SpeechRecognizer object when it is no longer needed.

For apps targeting Android 11 (API level 30) interaction with a speech recognition service requires element to be added to the manifest file:

<queries>
   <intent>
     <action
        android:name="android.speech.RecognitionService" />
   </intent>
 </queries>
 
.
This method must be called from the main thread of your app.

Parameters
context	Context: in which to create SpeechRecognizer

Returns
SpeechRecognizer	a new SpeechRecognizer

createSpeechRecognizer
Added in API level 8
public static SpeechRecognizer createSpeechRecognizer (Context context, 
                ComponentName serviceComponent)

Factory method to create a new SpeechRecognizer. Please note that setRecognitionListener(RecognitionListener) should be called before dispatching any command to the created SpeechRecognizer, otherwise no notifications will be received. Use this version of the method to specify a specific service to direct this SpeechRecognizer to.

Important: the caller MUST invoke destroy() on a SpeechRecognizer object when it is no longer needed.

Important: before calling this method, please check via android.content.pm.PackageManager.queryIntentServices(Intent,int) that serviceComponent actually exists and provides RecognitionService.SERVICE_INTERFACE. Normally you would not use this; call createSpeechRecognizer(Context) to use the system default recognition service instead or createOnDeviceSpeechRecognizer(Context) to use on-device recognition.

For apps targeting Android 11 (API level 30) interaction with a speech recognition service requires element to be added to the manifest file:

<queries>
   <intent>
     <action
        android:name="android.speech.RecognitionService" />
   </intent>
 </queries>
 
.
This method must be called from the main thread of your app.

Parameters
context	Context: in which to create SpeechRecognizer


serviceComponent	ComponentName: the ComponentName of a specific service to direct this SpeechRecognizer to

Returns
SpeechRecognizer	a new SpeechRecognizer

destroy
Added in API level 8
public void destroy ()

Destroys the SpeechRecognizer object.

isOnDeviceRecognitionAvailable
Added in API level 31
public static boolean isOnDeviceRecognitionAvailable (Context context)

Checks whether an on-device speech recognition service is available on the system. If this method returns false, SpeechRecognizer.createOnDeviceSpeechRecognizer(Context) will fail.

Parameters
context	Context: with which on-device SpeechRecognizer will be created.
This value cannot be null.

Returns
boolean	true if on-device recognition is available, false otherwise

isRecognitionAvailable
Added in API level 8
public static boolean isRecognitionAvailable (Context context)

Checks whether a speech recognition service is available on the system. If this method returns false, SpeechRecognizer.createSpeechRecognizer(Context) will fail.

Parameters
context	Context: with which SpeechRecognizer will be created.
This value cannot be null.

Returns
boolean	true if recognition is available, false otherwise

setRecognitionListener
Added in API level 8
public void setRecognitionListener (RecognitionListener listener)

Sets the listener that will receive all the callbacks. The previous unfinished commands will be executed with the old listener, while any following command will be executed with the new listener.
This method must be called from the main thread of your app.

Parameters
listener	RecognitionListener: listener that will receive all the callbacks from the created SpeechRecognizer, this must not be null.

startListening
Added in API level 8
public void startListening (Intent recognizerIntent)

Starts listening for speech. Please note that setRecognitionListener(RecognitionListener) should be called beforehand, otherwise no notifications will be received.
This method must be called from the main thread of your app.

Parameters
recognizerIntent	Intent: contains parameters for the recognition to be performed. The intent may also contain optional extras, see RecognizerIntent. If these values are not set explicitly, default values will be used by the recognizer.

stopListening
Added in API level 8
public void stopListening ()

Stops listening for speech. Speech captured so far will be recognized as if the user had stopped speaking at this point.

Note that in the default case, this does not need to be called, as the speech endpointer will automatically stop the recognizer listening when it determines speech has completed. However, you can manipulate endpointer parameters directly using the intent extras defined in RecognizerIntent, in which case you may sometimes want to manually call this method to stop listening sooner.

Upon invocation clients must wait until RecognitionListener.onResults or RecognitionListener.onError are invoked before calling SpeechRecognizer.startListening again. Otherwise such an attempt would be rejected by recognition service.

Please note that setRecognitionListener(RecognitionListener) should be called beforehand, otherwise no notifications will be received.
This method must be called from the main thread of your app.

triggerModelDownload
Added in API level 33
public void triggerModelDownload (Intent recognizerIntent)

Attempts to download the support for the given recognizerIntent. This might trigger user interaction to approve the download. Callers can verify the status of the request via checkRecognitionSupport(Intent,Executor,RecognitionSupportCallback).

Parameters
recognizerIntent	Intent: contains parameters for the recognition to be performed. The intent may also contain optional extras, see RecognizerIntent.
This value cannot be null.

triggerModelDownload
Added in API level 34
public void triggerModelDownload (Intent recognizerIntent, 
                Executor executor, 
                ModelDownloadListener listener)

Attempts to download the support for the given recognizerIntent. This might trigger user interaction to approve the download. Callers can verify the status of the request via checkRecognitionSupport(Intent,Executor,RecognitionSupportCallback).

The updates about the model download request are received via the given ModelDownloadListener:

If the model is already available, ModelDownloadListener.onSuccess() will be called directly. The model can be safely used afterwards.
If the RecognitionService has started the download, ModelDownloadListener.onProgress(int) will be called an unspecified (zero or more) number of times until the download is complete. When the download finishes, ModelDownloadListener.onSuccess() will be called. The model can be safely used afterwards.
If the RecognitionService has only scheduled the download, but won't satisfy it immediately, ModelDownloadListener.onScheduled() will be called. There will be no further updates on this listener.
If the request fails at any time due to a network or scheduling error, ModelDownloadListener.onError(int) will be called.

Parameters
recognizerIntent	Intent: contains parameters for the recognition to be performed. The intent may also contain optional extras, see RecognizerIntent.
This value cannot be null.


executor	Executor: for dispatching listener callbacks.
This value cannot be null.
Callback and listener events are dispatched through this Executor, providing an easy way to control which thread is used. To dispatch events through the main thread of your application, you can use Context.getMainExecutor(). Otherwise, provide an Executor that dispatches to an appropriate thread.


listener	ModelDownloadListener: on which to receive updates about the model download request.
This value cannot be null.
